Who are we speaking to today was speaking with Scott belsky Scott is the founder of behance he's going to tell us how to maximize our creative output how to use constraints to boost your creativity and the patterns he seen in top design companies I can't wait till

00:01:00 what's one thing about design that's clear to you that you don't feel as a state other people it's hard to take Wednesday I think that a few things become clear to me first of all design is very much the little things that make a big difference I think that little things tend to be overridden in big corporations and and sometimes D prioritize and small teams and yet some of these little things like whether it's the aesthetic in the 
00:01:30 and in in some part of the user experience or product whether it's a decision to professionally photographed apartments for Airbnb whether it's all of these little decision to end up making a big difference and it's one thing that a lot of entrepreneurs that I need with we'll get to that but they don't prioritize it I think the other thing that that companies later on I forgot is that your wall the wall the science of scaling 
00:02:00 business now is is is really like the core you know business type of practices you know that the the art of scaling a business it was very much designed it's it's it's non-scale things its interactions with people that's making experience actually design you know in a way that's consistent from start to finish reading this other thing that's that's 
00:02:30 that pretends to be forgotten in the last thing I would just say even though you asked me for one thing it is that the design is not only something that's customer-facing people build tools deeply influenced by the tools that they use to build tools design in your internal systems the tools that you use the business plan on making it more accessible and using principles of design and marketing tell people engage with the business strategy is critical to get people 
00:03:00 what are some of these principles of design I think it's helping people visit me see progress as it's happening rather than just cutting it out of the plane cuz it already happened when you feel progress or to make more progress I think a big part of it is merchandising the actual plan than what's actionable next stuff needs to be merchandised to people and how do you merchandise with design with great copy with less is more with 
00:03:30 bottles that are translated into graphics and and these are just things that will do and will spend time on for our customers and our marketing campaigns and maybe our boards but when it comes to internal it's like so it doesn't matter it matters a lot and not only doesn't matter to help people get aligned but it also helps yourself and as an entrepreneur I would always help translate using illustrator in our business plan to something really simple and and graphically 
00:04:00 trade it in a way that helps me also understand it so you won't send the mission Centric my let's go back in your history the last 10 or so years behance famous for having built a platform to help creative show their work that should show finish work to the world making ideas happen which inspired me to start my own startup I told you that before we respond for the first time and then I'm your new project which is the journey in between 
00:04:30 is also about maximizing creative output maximizing the potential in between in the harder part of the project Plateau what is that part well at a couple things here first of all when I hit when I say that in our business and I have always been Mission Centric and where I'm also implying that I'm also medium agnostic in a sense that if there's something I really am passionate about and I feel 
00:05:00 problem with solving and also is paired with empathy of the people that are actually suffering from that problem in this case would be Hansa was the disorganization of a creative world and if I can ever do a traditional know who did what the solution to that I thought should be medium agnostic meaning it should be a Network Technology essentially a book we also had a conference and is now in his ninth season then you can you conference and a series of paper products organization and it sort of seems crazy from an investor perspective for a company to be so cool 
00:05:30 put all over the place yet in every instance the mission of all of these things was the same to organize creative people looking back on it I think that that was a long game that really could have killed us many times in the short-term because when you're spreading yourself too thin it introduces risk it it splits the energy of the team in two different places if you can somehow pull it off you in a pound any more holistic friend that is really about a mission 
00:06:00 rather than a particular medium into all of your competitors that are medium Centric like I'm a technology company or Prince company if they can't compete with you you're running circles around them with your brand and with experience 360-degree experience you deliver to customers so I think there's one thread which is that when I really am committed to solving a problem I try not to be confined by a particular medium and its new product you referred to and I'm currently calling attorney in between is really just an effort 
00:06:30 to better understand and Chronicle what great artists are entrepreneurs or even leaders of big companies do to endure the middle of the journey the messy middle that no one wants to write about don't want to talk about depressing yours is full of anonymity and self-doubt and ambiguity and it's so fascinating to me how some of those Journeys fail and others succeed and what's done in the middle that we can learn from there is a gap between 
00:07:00 greater potential like their actual output and it's interesting that you're kind of touching that that like you know that try for that space Yeah clean like the idea and actually exactly what are some of the things that you seen people do to actually get through that stage but what you can do is you can't believe that you're incredible Vision or what you may actually achieve at the end is enough to keep you motivated I think that's a mess. 
00:07:30 oh you know I actually imagined where will be in years from now and that's going to that's what's going to keep me going it may get you started it may help you at times but the truth is is that we are all hard-wired for short-term rewards I remember one of the quotes shared by Fred Wilson one of our investors at behance in one of our first 99u conference is where he said that the two greatest addictions in Life or heroin and a weekly salary is so hard to unplug yourself we are 
00:08:00 born with this desire for short-term rewards for our parents in the form of love and gratification and then we get a check on the test in grade school and then we get agreed in the course and then we get a weekly salary in a potentially a bonus at the end of the year and then suddenly you unplug yourself from that when you choose to pursue an independent career as a freelancer or when you choose to be an entrepreneur or start a band or anything else it takes years in order to bring to fruition and you know you can rely on without their short-term Awards and when you're not 
00:08:30 the question is what do you do to survive that trough you have to hack yourself you have to hack your own reward system you have to find ways to keep yourself and your team engaged how do you do that all kinds of fun things some of its design putting things around you celebrating Milestones they basically made up in one of our things and I like to tell a story about a behance was every time you typed in B Hansen the Google it always said do you mean any chance do you mean and hands so we were always a mistake 
00:09:00 things I would tell my team in the early days was eventually if we get enough bands users to make profiles and projects me post enough blog post and we get enough to link tax to all the hustle we're doing to network around the web we will no longer be a mistake Google will think we're real and inevitably like a year later suddenly behance came up when you type it in and then I think it was a year after that were Beyonce became popular I thought it was a mistake again but it was just acts like that. All the difference 
00:09:30 your written quite a bit about this what role did a few constraints play in the creative process so I should really start on that answer with the the question that I would ask a lot of designers I interviewed when I was ready making ideas happen often times go to very productive prolific designers and I would ask them for a story around their nightmare break brief like when did things go horribly wrong and more often than not the stories would start with a 
00:10:00 open brief that they got in particular client where the client said listen big-picture don't even think about budget don't even think about timeline yet just like big picture and that there was routinely where the story is where it was a insufferable process to figure out where to go which illustrates the importance of importance of constraints on Earth are in a sense of resourcefulness which is much more important 
00:10:30 resources resourcefulness is is making you sad what's in front of you of entering yourself with things around you the constraints whether it's the timeline or some idea that someone else shared I just don't think that creatives can operate productively in a vacuum in an empty space with the coat boat that supposed infinite resources and no noise noise is actually a critical part of our process mistakes and it is something to 
00:11:00 think about that is our life becomes less friction filled and as the products in the services that we use to anticipate your every need kind of iron out the friction of our daily being what is that going to do to the fact that we know creativity is actually spawned from getting lost or sitting in traffic or dealing with deadlines are limited resources and it's it's an interesting question 
00:11:30 can I go in the face and everything we think we want their manufacturer constraints when your team's when you work with much as designers would really any 100% that's the role of the leader in one of the roles of the leader is to constantly reiterated merchandize the constraints and when you don't have logical obvious constraints find them seek done right and and and and Merchandising them because they help everyone and you can always 
00:12:00 maneuver around on you can always there's always an Exit Plan an exit strategy if something's not working but it's it's empowering to the team to have a tangible anchor and just just over and out of the abstract words that you would have deadlines be a constraint constraint a session on the client's behalf are we consider is a constraint a in a limitation around the type 
00:12:30 content or a direction that seems to constraining is obviously you know what can strengthen itself these are all ways of making us again tapping into are in a resourceful and finding way around it and it's up to the founder or the leader tutu defined by those constraints are important it's just not just putting it out there like $10,000 one week and again we always forget the importance of internal merchandising 
00:13:00 what is the idea generation gap at something that we heard you written on before what what is it and how can a designer know if they're in it I do believe that that ideas are the culprit in most ideas ever seen the light of day that's because as creative people we are addicted to the energy and excitement and frankly the high that accompanies a new idea it allows us to escape 
00:13:30 the doldrums our project management the it allows us to escape our lives and all of our self doubts and all of our daily Daily Grind and and and so a new ideas exciting and and the the the first thing we do when we get into one of those doldrums of project management you know one of those periods of time where are suffering is miss chatting up with another idea and I like to say that's why they're more half right now I was in the world there are no 
00:14:00 I think it's important to be optimistic about the future but always pessimistic about tasks and never never truly satisfied with the progress you're making always kind of question yourself and bringing yourself down to like a pragmatic realization that you're not making enough progress you have to do is hustle more the more pain you know the more potential Glory these are the 
00:14:30 Texas things I think as creative as we have to in our prayers we have to constantly remind ourselves then I think that there is this is strange what were some of the most productive thing to ask a little bit in the pain of their process I think that's cuz they know that that's when it's real I use a trick when I get a lofty with my dears I try and find Cenex or people around me that that tend to shoot them down and I had a friend the friend that I think that the inclination is to say 
00:15:00 I've got an amazing idea and I want I want to speak to a kindred spirit because I really really want them to love what I what role do Skeptics her or Cenex play in this process is it important question because tierpoint creatives like to hire engage people for their teams that are also like them it was that typical a but I like to have a beer with this person is why creative hire creatives and it becomes this intoxicated orgy of idea generation and nothing ever gets done 
00:15:30 so you kind of need the server monitor where or doesn't need a driver who is constantly reminding you about the budget in the timeline and the constraints they're sort of the opposite of the dreamers which are sort of the Debbie downers of the worlds the people are constantly saying wait a second and we're all the dreamers go to bed at night super excited about any new idea that introduced her his team the next day on the on the contrary the doors are going to bed at night excited when 
00:16:00 nothing in the pipeline no new things to interrupt our schedule and take us off track the healthy productive creative team has an extraordinary strong immune system that is powered by The Doors not the dreamers even think about the human body the way we stay healthy is our immune system kills off everything that's new right and only when we get an organ transplant do we need to suppress the immune system and empower the did the dreamers 
00:16:30 they called and introduce a new organ something new and actually changes who we are is so a great leader of a productive creative team and I saw this many times over the course of everybody making it is happening interviews with these teams I would meet great leader is constantly force of all hiring a lot of Dewar's I'll just dreamers empowering the doors 99% of the time but then making sure that the chemistry allows the doors to take it back and the dreamers to take called when there's something new a new problem to be solved a new brief to be considered 
00:17:00 you know that's when you empower the creatives the dreamers Wells Fargo investment companies like Pinterest Uber Warby Parker needs a really strong brands that people look to as the sign leaders as well write in your Investments like have you seen any patterns among these companies as far as how they approach and deploy design well it's one of those companies was either co-founded by a designer or had leaders that 
00:17:30 play really value design decisions and talent at the very start of their companies none of them outsourced design at any point in time which is actually interesting because most company is at least in the beginning to Outsource design and when you have ants or something what you're basically saying is it is definitely not your competitive Advantage when you do is you Outsource things that you just need like table with something needs to get it done but is not really core to what's going to make you stand out and so 
00:18:00 I look for teams that don't Outsource their competitive Advantage which is I think logical thing to look for as an investor and if I think that design is a real Court part of of what they will be building and how they'll succeed and send out you know that that's that's a starting point I also think that the the openness to feed back around products and design decisions the value mean like Warby Parker in an eel really would put his stamp on anything they would go out 
00:18:30 represent of the brand of that company and has he has scaled his business he's had to scale the ability to make sure that everything is consistent on brand on plane and design is a huge part of the consistency of the user experience at Warby Parker whether it's the shipment of your glasses or the store that you go into or the website you deliver you visit or the or the emails that you get the design is just a constant threat and I know his internal operations to support that 
00:19:00 congress not to other companies I won't even that I worked at before I where you had different departments making different decisions and if your product manager you have no say over what the email looks like that goes to your customers that's a problem okay so interesting now Outsourcing implying that your may be using a freelancer an agency of some sort right you know the platform for Freelancers agency designers client site designers all of them to kind of celebrate the work that they do I'm curious if you see 
00:19:30 answers and agency designers in and then people actually work on the client side as standing in stark contrast to each other and what can they learn from each other because I actually have seen many examples of hiring a create great freelancer and bring them essentially in-house as an extended part of the team working directly with you and to me that is less Outsourcing than going to an agency where they're basically managing you through an account manager 
00:20:00 and they're hiding in some ways they're process and they're hiding actually who's doing the work so I've seen many examples where companies will Embrace particular freelancer for something extremely important is often times as you guys know some of the greatest greatest greatest talents in the world don't work for anyone but themselves because they can and I don't think that that means you're essentially Outsourcing it be actually partner deeply with Brands and companies agencies in the other hand I believe 
00:20:30 maybe someone controversial e r a r a message from the Past new this is it they are coming from a time will you didn't know who to go to to get something done we didn't have the tools to manage creative Talent on their own terms or where they want to work and the idea of working with creative I guess I'm going to do that because I'm a company and and they're from a time where design wasn't the competitive advantage 
00:21:00 and and I just think and it's in where there was an old boy network of people who would Place ads and come up with ideas and execute them I think that that time is beyond behind us I think some of the greatest most Innovative agencies today or actually just building rosters of Freelancers that they have relationships with on platforms like the annex and I met many of these companies and the name Jason basically just have a outbound sales for / account management effort to build new business 
00:21:30 so they're their role in all this now is that they own the relationship relationship and then they are not bringing graves in house because I know that that's sort of an old thing and getting creatives on their own terms and they're serving as a conduit which is the step towards eventually then not even existing at all levels and companies being able to find Town directly build relationships and by the way how great is that for the talent the town 
00:22:00 basically gets paid more the client pays less cuz the middleman is cut out essentially and the relation to bits pain between the Koreatown in the company or brand are there any rules or responsibilities that you feel designers are not looking to or not building that might be costing them influence and credibility that these companies what you think that I think that 
00:22:30 all they were talking about here all this new opportunity that designers have to work directly with clients and really be the competitive advantage of all these different types of businesses across Industries with all that opportunity comes responsibility what is that what is that responsibility it means becoming a better manager and means being able to manage job and influence without Authority which is an entirely different skill-set they don't teach you this stuff and design school right I mean this is this is 
00:23:00 do you have to learn through on your own a lot of us to experience a lot of its through reading books and understanding and attending conferences and and considering that a big part of your education is not just design skills now it's now it's also management skills and and and and and getting herself on that learning curve so I ain't got to be part of it I also think that being able to make sure you can 
00:23:30 try for yourself simple things like asking for more money knowing what you're worth holding your clients accountable being able to fire a client's when you feel like they are stopping your energy and your soul and recognizing it. Short term sacrifice will yield long-term game I think that these are all sorts of parts of that responsibility set that we have to take on I want to go back for a quick second back to the agency World cuz there are 10 probably tens of 
00:24:00 a bathing suit designers listening to this I hope I want to give them a snowball's chance here for a second or not as I want to give him a real chance what are what should agencies other than building lines of contact in relationships with Freelancers best Freelancers in the world what else can agencies do to redeem themselves and not be mired by the legacy of what agencies were amazing agencies and 
00:24:30 what is agency is can do I think it there bass is be the non drunk participant in the process of bringing an idea to fruition bringing a different perspective for companies that are not thinking enough about brand because it's not in the DNA of their Founders or nothing about design green agencies become a thought partner and have a seat at the table that I worked with that I recommend and and want to work with a 
00:25:00 and again insisted on having a seat at the table. The actual talent into the process rather than trying to keep the talent secret and present the you know the business contact as the the person that you should interact with the best agencies that I work with are willing to give attribution to the people actually do the work because they are confident enough that they're adding enough value in an equation with the ideas and with the process improvements. 
00:25:30 you're not afraid of admitting that someone's doing the work just seems crazy but it's actually you know too commonplace so and it really you also in your greedy agencies are willing to work with the brand that's a little off and I think of agencies like red antler in New York. Takes a group of guys like the founders of Casper mattress company and says you know this is all going to be about your brand and builds as a long-term partnership 
00:26:00 to bring the Costco brand of life into so many people which I don't think would have happened without Riddler from what I know there's a lot of examples like that so that's the Modern Age agency I think it's often times agency founded by a creative talent and and really run in a way that you know is thinking about the modern-day clients we spoke about one of the skills that designers need to on develop his managing 
00:26:30 and I'm assuming presenting as well right I'm so assume you're a designer at a company and you're about to present a project to the CEO or non designer executive Ryan Howell should that Designer start the discussion what are the things that they should actually focus on in that discussion and how do they actually keep the person's attention which I see probably one of the biggest issues listen to Makkah is greater than has more power than hours of discussion and debate and I have been in so many 
00:27:00 meetings where there's a system pain in back and forth and memos being read and distributed and everything else and then someone just as much as look at it and if the designers in the room braids if they're not like shame on you bring them in and show some mock-ups and suddenly within minutes everyone's a line as to what should be done next designers Inc assert themselves to make it happen more quickly sadly still to this day it's either the product 
00:27:30 where the business unit leader where the CEO or someone else who has to advocate for the desire to have a voice in that conversation and has to make it so that the mock-ups end up leading rather than following designers need to take that's part of the responsibility and you're taking their ability of making sure that design leads the structure in companies either gets in the way of this or supports it I've always insisted on having designers report directly to me everywhere 
00:28:00 cover as this PP a product will let it go be where there was actually a design firm base of the in the company of a union is a separate Division if you will I insisted on having a series of designers report to me on the things that I was leading it was very controversial and rightly so because designers who are amazing Amazing Thailand designers in the company were saying you know why you know why are there now designers and better than product and businesslike what does that mean for us as it's like internal agency I think you have to 
00:28:30 position designers how to have the influence to be able to assert themselves and deleted discussion when you're trying to solve something as a business so there's a lot of structural work that needs to be done to make this happen and more broadly throughout business and end in other Industries in business so but designers play a critical role and at that should should push for that and in this example where you asked me was I report directly to you how were they structure beforehand like where they reported anyone like that look like 
00:29:00 designer is reported up into in this is many companies right and most even sort of company is there is a person who leads design designer support up to him or her and there are product managers and people running the business units and designers are there in stock on these projects but they're there their compensation and her performance is actually still reviewed and determined by the person who reads design it so that's like a break right there what do you mean like the designer is so critical to the business 
00:29:30 is able to be compensated by the person who's running the business or the product doesn't make any sense and then why would they feel like they can have their one-on-ones and get management advice and be able to assert themselves if they're working alongside people but not people that actually work for or west and so it's it's just say it's a been awesome, cultures and countries can still overcome this with the relationships why not structure at 2:16 in the first place so those are the types of things you think about me coming 
00:30:00 I'm coming back to this meeting this presentation. I seen examples where the designer gets to leave this meeting and they go they present they said they just put it right and then everyone just jump on that locked up happening is that feedback where the discussions that happened is not actually relevant it also a discussion. I'm so what concept should a designer be providing when they put that thing up on the screen to drive the time to say it's so important it's a great question it starts with asking you have to get to leave 
00:30:30 conversation you don't just put up a mock and then sit back and let the firing squad begin right you put up a mohawk and you say this is a concept what questions do you have an in this is the problem that you asked us to solve like the reason is not consist it's a solve the problem of the following problems start peppering the questions and then you help people understand it and people start to say things like make the logo bigger you know maybe make this blue or me agree 
00:31:00 designer asked the people to then rephrase it as problems they think still exist I actually am worried that people are not going to know how to buy why do you say that is not clear to me like how you actually go where is the action what's the default and I want to make sure that 90% of people actually do X those are the types of responses that's the feedback you should be getting a design Direction you should be getting problems that still exists because designer 
00:31:30 what was the South Providence and if your audience still has his problems you haven't succeeded yet I want to first of all apologize to our listeners and we heard about all the noise there's not a single corner of New York you don't hear some sort of Street noise and it's a little like always so we apologize for that we come back Scott I want to ask you a personal question so we'll be right back so soon thanks again to Squarespace for supporting to show Squarespace is the all-in-one platform to get a domain create a website or build an online store they have beautiful

00:33:00 important without it building strong work relationships gets a lot harder and that leads to poor collaboration I've also found the prototypes are great way for me to show my full vision for design and this helps cut down a lot of back-and-forth in Vision makes all of this really easy you can rapidly prototype your designs and collaborate across every stage of your project taking your ideas from concept to code it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design workflow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from Project managers

00:34:00 I have different mentors for different things than these are people who have gone back to at certain times or at help me at pivotal moments and I think it's dangerous to have one person you feel you want to look up to 90 late because you don't want to play someone else's play Buck at the same time I have made a mistake of insulating myself too much and as an introvert squid in my nature and I always felt like well 
00:34:30 sound Journey no one else knew about me and and I times I've been humbled by the fact that as soon as I force myself to ask somebody like what you would do to do I just totally realize that I was Reinventing the wheeler there's a logical answer so I push myself to go and visit these mentors occasionally and dumb and sometimes I'm finding it specially these days it's not a particular answer I'll get it's more just the conversation you some of the best discussions don't have an answer their judge 
00:35:00 the way of unwinding. I want you to put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't have the cash it at Scott belsky okay there's quite a business intimidation Factor right you look up to someone and you want to find them you want to seek them you don't want to impose too much but you can't do you want to ask them for help what's the right way to go about finding a mentor and then I'd like to I'd like to talk a little bit about how do you keep that relate 
00:35:30 Kendall is important to remind yourself that everyone super busy and has preoccupations and you and someone in that seems like they made it and they would be a great mentor probably has a whole other sweet of things that are not worried about and up at night thinking about and whatever else and and so the adventure ship comes out of relationships so when you just reach out and say I want a coffee it's basically saying I want you to blindly give me your time 
00:36:00 and on and it's I don't know like I always am so worried about it cuz nobody had I I like giving back but I also how much time do I actually have and I also feel like my responsibilities use my time towards think I can make the most impacting and often times those are talking to larger groups or working on projects that I think need to see the light of day and not telling my day up with coffees with people I don't know so I'm turning you know I think it's a good question I think that it starts with making it both ways 
00:36:30 I'm actually one of my one of my kind of mentors so I was recently Matt or visit went to visit he was saying to me that I was thanking him for his time and he was like going to know like this is exactly what I'm going through to a different level of my life and so there was a parallel that I felt in some ways he was saying this is why I'm giving you the time because actually I'm going yeah I needed to is what he was telling me it was great to find 
00:37:00 people like that and dumb and they're having people that have reached out to me you know that I'm sort of sad and I'm going through a career transition right now debating the sea no investor vs. operator vs. founder vs. CEO and and I'm thinking I like I actually think about that as well but I'm always out I'm kind of tearing there as well and I want a conversation around that so I think you want like all relationships to be a social and business to be mutually beneficial 
00:37:30 where's that and also just ask me a question like to know that someone will ask me to send an email and I don't even know the person but they'll pose like a specific question like two or three sentences of where they're at right now at a specific question and I'll just answer it so that I can I don't want Eliza mentor-mentee related if you were deciding between you what kind of questions would you be thinking about and I'll say it like this is what I would be doing and if it's helpful great 
00:38:00 5 minutes and it ended in a taxi or an imminent do you think they're more examples of when someone who thinks they need a mentor is really just needing to do this just asking the right question you know I think that I think that I think I'm just getting a question ask a question and getting their data points is important but I also have to say that a lot of the best lessons are learned the hard way and I do think that we get paralyzed too often by thinking we need someone else's if 
00:38:30 for help when in truth we just need to do the work and we just need to try to we just need to throw ourselves into something and recognize that somehow someway a labor of love always pays off just know how you expect and I'm Amazed by how true that is I have seen so many people take jobs because they paid 5 or $10,000 more or jobs because they said well I need to do this for a few years in order to do this later on 
00:39:00 can I get stock and they become middle managers are unhappy right and then the opportunity cost just gets higher overtime and switching and trying something new I have never seen a situation where someone who was doing something cuz they truly love it ended up just like totally as a failure it just always leads to something and they may start in doing something and they make no money for a while but they just like sort of end up somewhere else or having a chance circumstantial conversation with 
00:39:30 open house and then leads into another great role something always kind of pans out it's this weird kind of nature of humanity and evolution I guess is that you're just if you keep on this path towards you. Warmer warmer warmer warmer you got somewhere it so that means that stop sort of trying to plan and get him or advice before making a decision just make an incremental step toward something interesting to you and it will pan out do you believe in building on your strengths 
00:40:00 trying to make yourself whole by focusing on areas that you need more help on yeah well here's a we haven't answered this question is that what we're all trying to do in our careers as Freelancers are entrepreneurs or leaders of big companies is survived the messy middle of big bold projects and the messy middle to me is just two things its endurance and it's optimization it's this volatile kind of way right and 
00:40:30 and it's definitely not linear right it's always you have this great idea oshit this is really hard to execute okay like I'm going to make progress was not linear it's actually very volatile full of these down these Lowe's would you have to endure and these high is what you have to optimize and the highs are when something for some reason works and it could be in the way you're bringing people out of your team dropped my senior team who could be the way you're optimizing Your Own Way working and more often than not it's the way your product is working or not working 
00:41:00 so to answer your question I think it's all about optimizing the little things that seem to be working which are your strengths is circumstantial things that happen to work that surprise you or little things are getting traction near designer and you throw up all the stuff in your portfolio never cares and then suddenly one project goes viral you know and you're like I should be doing more of this and less of this I really think that that's how greatness and it becomes even greater is when you start to optimize and emphasize 
00:41:30 the things that people are paying attention to that are working and naturally DM precise at things that aren't I don't think it's about obsessing over fixing things that are broken which is country to logic that you should always fix things that are broken and fixed things that are that are broken so endurance in those Lowe's in optimizing the things that work in both how you work as well as how your product is you want to give it talk about the importance of deciding what you're going to be badass when you're working on a product 
00:42:00 first can you just explain a glass of p and 2nd do you think this is a tool that designers can use to help Focus their careers what what I mean by deciding what you're willing to be bad at is facing forcible the fact that if you try to be good at everything you're not going to be good at any one thing better than everyone else right and and that's how an individual or a brand really stands out and has a comparative advantage in an industry which is 
00:42:30 competitive advantage in something whether it's topography or illustration or infographics or whether it's you know being the best airline or being the best whatever and so in the process of doing that when you need to look at is the head of factors that distinguish you and your industry what are they is it your cheap Ray is it price is it availability like you're the one that's always just available and people call you 
00:43:00 I need someone last minute is it you're especially good at infographics and you're like just so good at design that kind of comes from math is it that you're like such a good concept artist that you're like so clever and you always find that little thing you put in that everyone kind of amino kind of engages with on a personal level we can find your thing but what you shouldn't be trying to do is be the cheapest and the most available in the best of Destiny's Bassett and Bassett. And so when you look at that 
00:43:30 access right and you're like okay I want to be I don't want to be known for Price going to be expensive and that's just the way I feel I'm going to be right I'm not competing on 99designs or something like that like I want I'm going for quality and you know what I don't want to be known for me didn't want to be known for typography work I want to be known for these you know these quick illustration type of work that can be done quickly or whatever it is for you and then when you make that decision. 
00:44:00 sex everything in a text to you Market yourself it affects the types of projects you say yes to and no two and you start to have like these standards that you project through your portfolio to the content you right through what you stand for and you have to find those things to distinguish you and I think that's so important and it's easy to say but it's hard to do because when were in the thick of it in our careers or in leading our businesses were liable to just take every opportunity we can get we're liable to say 
00:44:30 yes we're good at everything we're trying to do the best price and availability and this and that and in truth what you really end up sending out through is is finding out what you're going to do that at and are you are you deciding this at the beginning of your career like you know that the thing doesn't any designers are taught when it come out and design school or even just College I swap really miss to try everything figure out you know what you do like and then Focus your attention on the things that you do like or is this a self-assessment at you're doing from day one 
00:45:00 when your career is it to figure it out I mean you have to figure out what your strengths are or what you're being known for its coming back to that optimizing question if it's working where people are are all my clients saying I love working with you because you're always available to do last minute things or people saying to you. Cover you made for us is just like is winning awards for that story and like oh my God you're so good at these you know taking the gun was like a moment in time and capturing a visual area where they saying to you 
00:45:30 is Long Beach projects like creating a new type base or something like that I just love working with you in that capacity and you're the rigour you have insane games of the project for a year is amazing but you hear that in the beginning of your career and as your career progresses but then you have to decide what am I going to be known for it if you don't stop and make that decision you will never be known for anything I have a question around the design Community landscape 
00:46:00 when you started behance you know you were solving a problem with a design comedian that problem was attribution and a place to be discovered since then the design landscape has changed a lot a lot of things to remain the same but they're a lot of new things that did not exist by 10 years ago right so I'm really curious if you were to start being ants again today what would that look like like what would you be trying to solve what would you be going after the big the big pony Grill problem that I always wanted to solve a T Hance but didn't have 
00:46:30 we haven't yet as a you know as a sanity hanstein and family is is around a better way of matching Talent with opportunity. On that sort of transcends the traditional circumstantial ways that people get matched up I don't think the answer is certain that the answer is not crowdsourcing I think that hurts more than helps I don't think that these commoditizing marketplaces for design or good 
00:47:00 I think that actually there's pricing power for the designer when he or she is match with the perfect opportunity but how do you make it clear that that's the perfect person for you as a brand to work with how do you match the two of you and how do you make sure that great content personal Rises to the top and it's not always the same Usual Suspects that are trending at the top of a search and then and then how do you make two people work together in a superior way over time with with high in with a high price 
00:47:30 and I think the dots there so many like odesk so desk type up work you know whatever things in the world that help people match and if it's still all about like price and availability and it's not about is high-quality creative relationship between a client and a brand so that's the problem. I find still very interesting and I think it still is behind the head of the ants in Adobe potentially your other company is out there so I know we're running short on time you have to leave soon we've got a couple of community 
00:48:00 do you want to get suture and he should be rapid fire how should designers explain the role of design two people in their business I think the designer should always Crown design as the as the discipline a problem solving right and so it's as well as young those little things that make a big difference I think that it's also important for designers to help their clients internally or externally 
00:48:30 play right I understand that there are solutions are are coming from years and years of experience and exposure and portfolios they looked at and critiqued and everything when I favorite stories about the whole kind of Paul Rand Steve Jobs relationship was when they negotiated on the rate for so long and then like ripe Olive and is immediately scribbles this thing and give see this thing and he's like what the fuck are you kidding me I'm hanging the sixth sixth finger song and it for like 2 minutes of work music 
00:49:00 for like 30 years of work done and it's so as part of the education career designers have to do with our clients South understand where the solution is even coming from so making sure that your discipline is regarded as one of problem solving making sure that clients understand sometimes a little things actually make the biggest difference helping your clients understand that it's an end and experience that's being designed it's not just the splash paid or some part of the product those are things that you need to push the 
00:49:30 question when you're the only designer at a company out of business I'm what are the things that you can do to convince leadership of its value well I think that showing not telling and speaks volumes right when I bet it and it is also the aspect of merchandising what just happened when you show something that holds the argument and suddenly brings it to another level sometimes you can actually 
00:50:00 Teresa mock-up into a debate and actually expedite the decision and help get people lined with her quickly and no one even knows that it was the design and the designer that. Success should be attributed to it so important as a designer that circumstance to get to bring that to the liter is a tension this is why you know just taking a setback I feel very lucky to have had this design diagram from college and took all these design classes then he went into business and then I 
00:50:30 Focus new design community and really jumped into being a product designer basically with my team and also had a background leadership development so I'm always kind of a weird mix in the thing I'm always taking out of it is that designers are not considering themselves leaders in a team for not being powered as leaders in teams and the company is it actually believe it design is competitive advantage and Empower designers to haven't seen the table and Lead 
00:51:00 and be structured internally and compensated internal it in the right way are the ones that you know how that can that Advantage come through in the marketplace so we can end with his last question is the function of design continues to evolve what are some roles in methodologies that you think will emerge over the next five years I think that I think that design is starting to become a competitive advantage on the Enterprise tool side of things I think that it's 
00:51:30 in such a consumer product focus in actually is funny in the investor landscape people still consider themselves either consumer product investor or an Enterprise right investor and you know what are people using the products and when you're making the investment you need the same lens around products sensibility and how the team structure in our designers and power to make a difference and all these different things sure the business model and they go to market may be different in the pricing things like that but but the products themselves 
00:52:00 need to be borne by the same principles and how do you get designers all jazzed up to work in a company that builds Enterprise tools but I think that but you make this going to make a big difference anywhere to see more of that I think that the the interface is the place where a lot of Industries are finally becoming competitive being determined in terms of who wins answer if I got slap a hand came in a great product 
00:52:30 building an interface for the technology that they built and then another product is building interface that just made some uses the apis of that product and then another product is like an audible version of the new a visual or audio UI and then and it's like it's an interface game but guess what that's all designers right designers only interface and the future is going to be determined by interfaces by screens in her home by audible Qs by you know all of these sort of a I supported 
00:53:00 frictionless interfaces it's exciting it's an exciting time to be a designer and to be thinking about Industries and problems that just need to be rethought that's a good place and thank you Scott you're having me Hey Man 3 on congratulations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if you did like it please leave us a review on the iTunes Store and by the way if you have any questions that came up because of the content that we covered with our guest go on YouTube

00:00:00 hey welcome to high-resolution my name is Bobby Gould Shaw and I'm Jared around it we're going to sit down with 25 masters of the design industry and we're going to learn from them we're going to learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and deploy design and their businesses every single day in this episode or experiences and you stories  00:00:30 how to lead a discussion we're going to get to that stick around right after these partner messages thanks to Squarespace for their support whether you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move is Squarespace visit squarespace.com and enter the code high-resolution one word for 10% off your first purchase hey thanks for joining us what's one thing about this it's clear to you that you feel00:01:00 is not so good other people getting better but I would say some still don't know that design is more than what you see Steve Jobs said that it's not just what it looks like the how it works I'm paraphrasing of course I believe in that but there's a little bit more to that when we think about design Ralph and thinking about solving problems design its simplest is just being intentional about something trying to sell 00:01:30 problem thinking about the end-user hopefully doing so in and maybe a collaborative fashion and it heard of fashion these are often times the rules of design but you can use those tools for really something kind of almost any problem so it might be in what the interface on a nap looks like and what color is it has and where the button go and how that works but it can also be the strategy or the shape of the org and how people work together and who were 00:02:00 these are the types of things that you can use that tool set of design that's all for and I don't know if that's wide enough it's known wide enough but we're getting there for sure what is what is that tool set so that's interesting so it sounds like you're saying that there's this thing that we can use call design for things outside of user interfaces we can solve business problems and we can design teams using this process what what are some of the things that you've used in this process 00:02:30 let's be clear while there are people that have job titles that and go designer like myself to teach design is a method for solving problems as I mention it's about bringing intentionality to it and good design I feel includes a humanistic approach try to consider who the end user is and don't work you might be thinking about what who are the people in that organization that are going to 00:03:00 affected by what the shape of that organization looks like and so either you bring the tools of research and you get out and you learn from those individuals what they want what they don't want try to understand and what might come of these decisions that you might make and then the other part of the tool set is iteration designers great designers utilize iteration and so that might mean that they make a low Fidelity version of their their idea their solution first and test it out so that they again can learn from the end-user 00:03:30 to know whether or not it's working basically leaving your assumptions on the table so to speak and trying to find what that right solution might be another tool in that tool set would be a collaboration a great designer believe works with a collaborative team a multidisciplinary team because and we don't know every answer and I'm trying to say that because I can solve just about any problem well we're not an expert and just about any problem people using designer not an expert in everything so you have to bring people together other experts 00:04:00 can learn from in order to develop those Solutions one of the things that in my in my designer past I found to be really interesting is iteration once you get the hang of it once you understand that that's a key component of the design process it become so obvious that you need to do it cuz I think mother superpowers designer tab is that we can just create stuff from The Ether and do it a thousand times really quickly 00:04:30 Engineers don't have that Leisure but the kind of Flip Side to that coin is when you enter 8 on something and you do it at low Fidelity the business people might like the non-designers seem to generally not be able to get past the fact that it looks like crap but and needs to look like crap in order in order for it to move forward like how would you explain the art of iteration of the importance of iteration to someone in the business 00:05:00 okay I know it's here you it can be difficult to show somebody something that isn't all the way I thought through and you know they start poking it and will that that copy is wrong or you know that it's too big for the area that's going to be and they might have great points but you're you're trying to direct their conversation props to something else I've been keeping it low Fidelity and helping them see the stages of what you're working towards I think one way to solve for that is that you show them what like what you can do 00:05:30 terms of the High Fidelity version like moved it to this polished screen that has all the right bells and whistles but in order to get there first. Make sure we have no idea right or interaction model right or like let's make sure that you know before we go and move desks around you know when we're going to put new signage up and everything but before we do that like let's try to scenario plan here what is it going to look like when we have people over here and poop over there I've been think through and some of those scenarios like what was going to come in at what meeting right like you give yourself examples of that 00:06:00 but I think that they need to be able to know that you will get it to the end speaking about organizational design if you've been here for a few years and Airbnb since then the design side is like reshuffle of it right now structure however you guys work together and that's a that's like it's going to happen that sense of adaptability but how is everybody at your post office yeah I mean I would definitely going to company with him hyper growth and yeah I start 00:06:30 here almost 3 years ago and it was about 10 people in the experience of 19 and now it's close to 80 how to change but so much has it maintained through that a lot of the good things in and some of the challenges of course to I guess how we approached it is that one starting from what do we want to stay the same and knowing that we're going to growing in our mission is help anyone belonging 00:07:00 where and you know we can't do that unless we scale our mission requires that kind of global scale but if we're going to do that if we can expand our team here and abroad and make sure that we're spending our product we need to figure out when what are the things that are principles or values that you just can't change and I think we're pretty lucky that our Founders got that from the get-go and they prioritize culture on a cultures been a really big thing for Airbnb and I think that's one of the reasons why we've been six 00:07:30 because we worked really hard to make sure that everybody that works here is passionate about the mission is excited to embrace the adventure of building a business ends in uncertainty and challenge has come to a head of us and that people are really strong and their skills and that I think has helped to make sure that they are no matter what we do and no matter where you are in the world you know you're working long Summit side somebody that you don't mind that you're banging your head against the wall through late at night 00:08:00 I got a heart problem I can trust the people that we work with him that's been a big deal so when I first joined super small Peanut the time I will have the right size but I have 10 people time to utilize in research and so I did one-on-one interviews with people on the team I did what I want interviews with 00:08:30 Partners II product an engine try to understand it and what was working and what wasn't working with them in the designers of course me to look at the work and there where the process was and how things were going there basically just do you know any other design project and then started too kind of shape what the opportunity and again it's not like we're just going to let you know to redesign the design team without in cluding the designers and the product manager. 00:09:00 and so we did a lot of workshops and we talked about your the types of things that we could do to improve it one of the problems we had at the time is that wasn't a real sense of togetherness in the design team and that's because there were 10 designers and probably around 11 product teams being that the product teams were being focus on different areas of the product right and these designers were sensitive working on Islands by themselves and with engineering and project managers but not other designers and they were sitting in all sorts of different places 00:09:30 identify that is an opportunity area the other place that we saw some challenge were the designers were feeling like they were only utilize basically at the end of the design process and they fell under utilized where nobody was happy it sounds like 00:10:00 wasn't it in designers or intentionally left out of the decision-making process is that there's a miseducation or lack of Education around how designers actually should work into a process there's only so much I can assume it's like how it got there ain't no but I think it's everybody's at fault right how it got there right where the designers actually holding up their end of the bargain you know where the designer showing that they should be at the table at the earlier stages 00:10:30 I mean there's any number of reasons why it might have been that way maybe the designers and walked away from that or maybe they once were at the table and it didn't work out I don't know as much as to what happened before I got here I will certainly try to understand why things were the way they were but really and it wanted to shift or thinking into how could it be better and a lot of that was about Shifting the mindset of the folks that are currently in building and also part of that was hiring so if you looked at the team and thought okay we will have these skills 00:11:00 visual people are really good at interaction design but we're missing some facilitators we're missing the people that you know can come into the room and grab the Whiteboard marker and activate a whole room and that's in one of the places where in a designs upfront value really starts to come out right is that like before there's even an idea they're already providing value in terms of like how the thing is working now the conversation is working until we started hiring for people like that some people that we know we're going to round up a skill sets of the team 00:11:30 the one we built into the team these different individuals people at different and kind of suit levels of seniority people with a different mix of skills it was harder to become revealing to do engineering managers as well as the designers how design can be better leverage it was inspiring for them to see how design could be a part of earlier stages in the process of planning and strategy conversations and just general facilitation so things are at the shift and we could do to build up a team another 00:12:00 as I mentioned that we had folks on Islands right so building up a team so that we always had at least designers in pairs working on things together we and our design team here call basically all of the folks are focused on the design of the product that you are in and the you ask experience designers and that's because there's more than into the pixel 3D experience but everybody does a little bit of both UI and ux but of course there's like different levels right now 00:13:00 the managers and I and we're in a people are going to go and how we balance out skill sets you know I might just be because I like to drink so much but I kind of think about it it's like building a good cocktail I feel like it's all like all the ingredients to think about if they're soft skills I know some folks are a little bit in a better at the end of the conversation 00:13:30 part of the presentation apart presentation part there's some folks that are bit more introverted some little bit more extroverted anything goes as long as you're thinking about the composition and how it comes together there's a great study and I'm not going to remember the person's name but it's a 10 talk but I'll dig up later and show you what this woman did a study about chickens and laying eggs and she basically put all of feel like the best chickens together and thought like let's see if they make the most eggs next to this other group that were 00:14:00 dinosaur mountain Just Do It remix of chickens and lo and behold the like super group of chickens did not do better they basically fought the whole time in the other group The heterogeneous group would like nice mix of all like skill sets analogy for a team in terms of making sure you have that right mix you don't want just like the ATM and 00:14:30 I think I don't know so it's looking good plus one plug inclusivity and things yeah the Airbnb experience of course is bigger than digital you guys have the physical world experience as well do you have the do you guys think of experience as a system or do you think of it in the worlds of physical experience and digital experience 00:15:00 we do think of it as a system that includes digital and physical The Experience design team does include folks that are focused on UI and ux it also includes skin folks that are on focus on illustration and animation people that are more service design minded folks are a mixture of these types of things together the I guess the thing that isn't necessarily a perfectly captured in the job title is 00:15:30 when we are looking for these individuals we're not just looking for somebody who's going to have a portfolio of nothing but pixels or could only speak about the pixels we're looking for the people that are going to be able to talk about how those pixels have ramifications in the real world and can consider those ramifications which you know is really something that kind of transcends time and place I mean it can be very challenging things but that's the Crux of what Airbnb is the pixels which of course you are our tools to in 00:16:00 this experience they're only a very small part of an experience someone has an air B&B most of it probably 99% of it is then in the offline World interacting with strangers people that probably speak a different language on another side of the planet and so it's imperative that were thinking about those things when we're looking at a pixel in so something as simple as you know the words that we choose to the size of the buttons are they inability to get to the button is going to be impacted by the fact that you know somebody might be on their phone 00:16:30 turn into a locked apartment and it's late at night until we have a Giants and it was on the wall for all to see but we actually use it things like this in our design process every day I've been thinking about in terms of pictures and in terms of those stories like a comic strip what is the experience that someone's going through what is the context of their use and that really does help 00:17:00 remind us that it's more than just what we see on you know where screens there and that's one of the many things that we need to do of course research and getting out there ourselves using the park or cells or other ways to reminder inspector a design Centric company Design Center company is one that probably doesn't leave well enough alone 00:17:30 I meant know that I thinking of people the end-users first wants and needs to change and evolve and to stay ahead of it by looking for opportunity and iterating and trying new things and exploring with a want to make it better I think that's it do you think Airbnb is that yes I would definitely 00:18:00 we're lucky that we have design at the the heart of this company I wonderful thing and see how I'd say an advantage to having design as part of the company from the gecko and that's kind of permitted within our culture and I mention that culture is so important it's not like we're hiring for designers no matter what and I'm across the entire board no matter what this winter in 00:18:30 but certainly thinking about the end user is a part of it at one of our core values is being a host and that is a very design like thing I know right it was I thinking about you who's going to use this is how they're going to interact with it and that should be a part of every day thinking and I think we also have a rather ambitious culture where in a we do want to make a big impact in this world in our mission is to have anyone belong anywhere and that is a big meaty mission right 00:19:00 anyone anywhere right and that's basically Shifting the the mindset of a whole lot of this planet but we're here because we do believe that we can go after that but we're going to have to take on a lot of heavy and hard work to get there by then I think that's a part of

friends and envision for their support and vision is the world's leading product design platform powering the future of digital design through their deep understanding of the importance of collaboration there use my some of the most Innovative companies in the world like Facebook Capital One Airbnb and Netflix let me tell you three reasons why I use it one poor communication is one of the biggest 00:20:30 Vitalis the teams to when you don't get feedback from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and 3 without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for design in Vision salts all of that you can rapidly Prototype at the front end of the design process and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design workflow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from Project managers to designers develop 00:21:00 and Riders teams that build digital products are in a serious Advantage when they use in Vision Suite A prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit Envision app.com and use our access code inv high-resolution for 3 months free so few years ago everybody put out a Rebrand and it's I mean it's beautiful like we just walked by the load ourselves coming into this room by anytime you're launching something that big especially when it's in brand when you could 00:21:30 preview it to the majority of the world there could be a lot of fear of weather is going to be well-received and it's going to fail right now it did not go up there but walk us through that that experience of actually designed a thing at the Paragon team for such a big lunch and for whatever exception you guys may have received the rebranding a company that at that time was a pretty large 00:22:00 tell me about 1500 2000 people worldwide people do about our product all around the world and we were about to change the face of it so yeah it was and it's scary it's exciting but it wasn't anything done overnight it wasn't anything done in a vacuum and I think that helped give us the confidence that it was the right thing to do or going in the right direction we went through a very long design process in terms of creating the logo and typography which did happen before I was here it was 00:22:30 close to 6 months of iteration and our house Community for one as well as some gas were a part of that process and we did get feedback from folks along the way and when we applied it to the product until you're bringing the color system the typographer system in really just the kind of the essence of the new brands to the product that as well it was probably even more challenging because we're about to move things around on people that have been using our product for many years and we did that again with included parts of our community obviously we couldn't share it with 00:23:00 called yet but we wanted to understand that it wasn't just what we thought was right but that the others could identify with it our product is all about a community and so of course it couldn't be done completely and isolation what do you think the learning here is that in a when you're launching something and it helps if she can do your best to remove the rest of the surprise and then try to iterate in as we talked about earlier with a kind of maybe a lower Fidelity version or a partial version 00:23:30 and try to test aspects of your hypothesis so that when you are launching something that you put all this Blood Sweat and Tears in the reactions shouldn't be surprising I'm at scale you know you never know what happens of course you have to be ready for that and you know you know you have to know you tried your best and that you can always change you can always iterate especially in the digital world we're very lucky that we can in a fine tune as time goes in and observe feedback but yeah I think it could be hard for a designer to 00:24:00 it kind of put their heart and soul out there through their work and feel at risk of what would have people hate it but you know if you don't try anything you'll never get to a better solution and that risk that you take can be minimized I have through going through a process of including others and trying it yourself and prototyping and experimenting with whatever you can so that by the time you get there you'll know with confidence that it's the right direction informed 00:24:30 miss you but not it's it's not you can stick your finger in the air and I hope that you do the right thing you guys put in all the work up front to make sure that your core Community loved it and that when you guys actually went to Market it was in the back of it you're waiting for the masses it was by believing in the decision process and the design process and of course now 2 years later what an amazing brand it is right what an amazing Mark and it's everywhere and it's friendly and it's beautiful I think it's looked at as one of the great rebrands so congratulations 00:25:00 so earlier you mentioned that everybody uses storyboards to document like to use our journey that you're going to be designing for right outside of design process turtling ask one of those examples of using a maybe a lower Fidelity way of getting to what the end solution should be so you can kind of gained by an and demonstrated Direction and excited and also prototype it to understand whether or not it's the right thing so storytelling can be really at any 00:25:30 age of the Unicorn product development process with problem solving process it's a powerful one because it's something that every individual can identify with and so if we can tell the story of what a person is going to go through and we help people kind of start to understand a little bit about that person and see what challenges they might have and how this might be better for them they can start to see themselves within that and they start to imagine you people they know and experiences they've had and it really helps to 00:26:00 the heart strings and get that understanding of what it could be in somewhere that might come in let's say that we have no a new idea for a new product and we could talk about the list of features of this new product like you're going to be like one-click to such-and-such whatever whatever 00:26:30 imagining something different or what that's going to be and everyone's probably thinking of what they already know of and just thinking of us and it was like very and on top of that but let's say instead you or anyone on the team who's got another idea for a new feature that's going to be something that no one's ever seen before and you want them to understand that you told him the story maybe you help them understand what the current predicament is alright well we have you know a family of 5 they want to go away to Vermont in the weekend 00:27:00 the mom spends 3 hours and Airbnb trying to find the right place she needs in a wheelchair for a wheelchair or young kids and they have a pet and they're going through all of these trials and tribulations to find the right place now let's imagine that with this new feature that and we already know what her needs are because we've seen that from her previous booking so she comes in and right front and center are the places that we know would be the right fit for her and you can show this to pictures 00:27:30 and highlight the things that this place will have based on her needs and you can talk about how this experience is going to be better for her and really like to help them understand like her name is Anne and she lives in Newark New Jersey and cultivate this kind of understanding of contacts that now and the people in the room are all the sudden like getting these really kind of like visceral images in their mind about an from Newark and the trials and tribulations of her booking experience 00:28:00 can a little bit about that product idea that you had instead of a list of features you told it in the story of what that thing might look like in the headlights you can break it down two features later you can scope out the engineering work later at first and just like any other human would try to understand it in terms of you know what the person is going through my mess with people can really identify with and so it helps sell the story and it helps frame saw the work frame at work and helps you actually even execute on it because you can be reminded of those 00:28:30 stages and needs to go through so that you don't leave anything out when you're actually building it talk about storytelling for a second I think one of the most interesting exciting things that airbnb's launch recently strips super cool can you think back to maybe like one of the first conversations you had with Brian or really any anyone on your team or in one of the business at where you told a story then ballet 00:29:00 headed that trips might be a thing that's interesting to explore the can you can you think back to a time where that raps from a long time as I mentioned that storyboard us a really powerful tool and thinking about trips because when we put it together and this was before I got here that destroyed first came together it has I think like 15 frames or something like this in so it's got guest frames like a comic strip and Scott host frames 00:29:30 and when you do that and you look at it and think about where is the Airbnb product a part of this journey and where is it helping and where is it not you realize that it's probably only in about five of the frames there is a quite a bit of it the on offline travel experience where are you you're not using the Airbnb product that much it's so it's the host it's the place that you're traveling it's what you put yourself with one of your friends and etcetera that are actually in providing 00:30:00 servicely experience not Airbnb and it was very revealing to us at that moment is that like me know there's more here there's more we could be doing to help people feel a sense of belonging with her traveling and that I was one we're just story like ignited this want for us to do more and then trying to go to down the pipe that you're talking about is like well how did it help us actually find the right thing to do in and get everybody excited, directions actually there were a series of stories done one where we are 00:30:30 what might be you know a tourist experience today and I like for the opposite of what we were going for and so we filmed people that we're having this experience and finding ways that it wasn't that great until finding those moments where you know an individual was getting lost in the area called the tourist spot in the big bus over the only the fridge and and seeing the things that most tourists to and then 00:31:00 we get another video where in a we gave the best experience of the best trip that we could and try to see what that opposite look like or what that difference look like and found that it was absolutely there was a ver there another there's a much better trip to be had where we were considering the individual and considering and what a local night do I was just what a tourist might do that I can have when your mom comes to visit and where do you take her those are the questions we should be asking not like 00:31:30 where in of the Taurus are going and I think about those Little Gems that you know in the San Francisco that you know that's what and if we want people to see if we want to give them a sense of belonging in this place before you start finding repeatable pattern cuz I can't imagine is just the first one right cuz that's kind of one datapoint stories you tell is dependent on how many scenarios are trying to bring the light it's actually remarkable that I don't think you need to get in a hundred different people telling their 00:32:00 in order to get you know that the quantity behind it it's actually you know you need you know just usually just a few stories to kind of in plant the seed in people's mind and let them you know remember like Bobby and Jimmy and Anna and Sarah in all these individuals just give them one or two and no latch onto the stories you can back up that sentiment for data and other ways Ryan so let's start with a story and then you know we can run a survey or you do online analytics understand like 00:32:30 is there a lot of people that might feel that way but the thing that really takes root in people's minds the images of a take root in their mind I don't want too many cuz you too many stories and they just going to say all circuits blend together and I forget how can I design who's working at a company who has never done this process before trying to apply at this I could only imagine that there's someone watching this right now he's like well this is throwing up my stomach and throwing out all the business goals and trying to reframe it as a story to go presenta like stakeholder someone 00:33:00 but that's probably not enough contacts the price what are the things that they should be looking for it actually presented that meeting at the great question I think it's as a people problem understanding that there are people that have this and where in your idea will take root in that world and that context the business case the quantifiable or the data that you have behind it is 00:33:30 it's supportive it shouldn't be the lead right when you're in a setting up your pitch deck and you really want to come ignite want to and participate in this until you throw money and invest in your startup and help people understand that this is something that real people are going to deal with and then let them understand it and in a basic terms like a classic man we reached out to our community and we asked them to help us or some questions 00:34:00 5 questions that are burning for the communities are we going to get into these next alright the first one is how do you explain the role of design two people in your business people in my bed just like the minors in Airbnb how do you explain the role of design the people at Airbnb this week we have a big company event. 00:34:30 I talkin to solving problems just like we started here you know it's not just what something looks like but it's how it works and I have I often times and tell a story about giving them an example of where design isn't or where something was poorly designed I have because that's usually the most revealing place where like oh yes that like that could be better but I like people to understand that your design is by noon 00:35:00 and something that you'd only this one team can own and that's one of the reasons why in the storyboard is on the wall for all to see and that's one of the reasons why it would try to be a very collaborative team is that I can we can all be problem solvers yeah we are off in the ones that are in the most skilled at leveraging tools that help us quickly visualize we're also the ones that are in her constantly exercising at muscle of problem solving and generation and experimentation but it certainly doesn't mean that something that we're going to go and do an island 00:35:30 but I hoped you and inform people that design is very much a problem solving process and and very much one that we want them to participate in the house and design Oregon Airbnb currently are currently structured design work is for parts it's experience design design operations research and content strategy and these four parts work really closely together to meetings together we sit together we work on everything basically start to finish but that's why 00:36:00 in the larger product or which is also a multi-disciplinary and collaborative and so we also sit alongside product managers engineer's and data scientist and the way that our Design Team Works in terms of these four parts is that we are basically integrated and distributed among the product teams we have I have area seems like Marketplace or growth and within those teams will have product managers Engineers designers data scientist researchers 00:36:30 I just excetera all working together on that problem and so that they can be hyper focused on that problem in the goals that they have and become experts in that area but then when you think about it kind of like laterally we is a design team and interact and Cheryl learnings across because if we just look only at growth we might lose some moments in between between users journey and so that connection between designers on different teams is really important so that's why we focus 00:37:00 I'm bringing the design team together as one entity so their business is out there with one or two designers hardly a designed to when you're the only designer in a company how do you convince the company of the value of design I got you if you're the only one so I guess I know some that we were essentially in 00:37:30 elevator at first then we were Venture Capital firm essentially what was different about us and that we invested in startups of design and receive equity in return and his work early save startups like really small teens at x 5 people in an engineer or two marketing person in the CEO and they were there was a great sign that they understood designed to some extent but yeah you know of course A lot of times when they're bringing one designer that they're looking for that it'll make it look pretty type of thing and I think one thing that a designer 00:38:00 you know it needs to do in order to scale themselves and to really have impact is to you no help that team see more than that see more than just the in pixels but also the process to get there and include them in and help them understand the value of user research getting out there and talking to people it's remarkable how many companies don't do that I'll get out there and and start storyboarding the journey and what are people going through and think about you know what is it working when is it not 00:38:30 before I almost wanted to leave my company and create a story map because it was such a need for startups to actually think about their Journey because a lot of them are at and if you think about your journey and you put a baby in a storyboard or a diagram and then you map it I can we call it a happiness curve and you draw a line like when is it going well and when is it bad super revealing right she's might be imma get that whole team around that idea they can start to understand a little bit more 00:39:00 and hopefully we'll see your value but more importantly hopefully it will start to you know in bed those Sentiments of design and that told her that we talked about originally in order to make the company better so at large how should designers actually Define measure and then presented design results when their project I don't know if we've ever talked about it as just design results probably because we're so kind of hyper focus on being really collaborative team 00:39:30 that's where the best results come from is they have through this team is going to balancing and leveraging these different disciplines put design actually works really close with the data scientist team and of course we are at the start of a design project or a a product development project we're going to look at and where are we now and what it what are the challenges today and and then we start to impeach the other Solutions we're including data science in that price 00:40:00 a lot of times and they're bringing great ideas to the table in terms being solution based on me and some of the things that they're seeing and different trends that have been happening over time but also they're helping us kind of shape how we might ship it right so engineering and data science or really major part of how we're going to go and watch something that it's very rare that we launched something that's just like a holy new overhaul of a product 00:40:30 the reason why is because it's very difficult to learn from and so often times what we're doing is taking that in a kind of end result that dream scenario the end Vision that we've created and breaking it into smaller pieces that we can ship learn from it right on and then build on and build on it so you know by the end of the year for months we've completely overhauled the work but it's been a step came to that and there's any help us do that and so when we're looking at each individual staff 00:41:00 seeing how it's working those are the moments where we're going to assessing whether or not it was a success and yeah I don't know if we ever think about it in terms of like with the design of success with the products and I want to add more than just the design of course I think we could finish with this question as the purpose of design starts to evolve and continues to evolve as it has been for the last decade what are some roles and methodologies that will continue to emerge over the next five years 00:41:30 what's so exciting I I don't know but I certainly I'm seeing a greater and greater need for designers to think outside the pixels which is ironic because everything is becoming more and more digital and of course and we're getting into virtual reality and and things are becoming three-dimensional but all the more reason that we have to think in a Beyond those screens and those goggles in the various devices machines are coming and they're absolutely and our machines are coming they're here 00:42:00 they are replacing a lot of the things that humans do everyday but that only unlocks more opportunity for humans to spend their time and their brain space and one other things one example is in design pools are getting ever more robust and capable and then that they're starting to bring design and Engineering closer together and so that we can you know create in Prototype it and build make all at the same time just really exciting but because of that 00:42:30 then we have moments in our day that we can think about other things right hopefully it helps make those things faster and so we can think about in the challenges of in a two individuals that don't speak the same language on the other side of the planet coming together putting aside their diocese and to know their inability to understand each other's first starting point to actually break down those barriers those are the things that we can be spending your time thinking about in a government where does a 00:43:00 policy thinking about more inwardly how they might design their company is it supposed to and it just following suit with what was there before so I'm excited I do there always have to follow I still don't know where the time it's okay I think we make it up on a day-to-day basis and I think we definitely. 00:43:30 looks like and I'll need to really think about how things work and think about how we can apply that to things that you aren't already being designed but things that you are in desperate need of new ways of thinking and not leaving well enough alone wow well thank you so much Katie and skinny hey you made it to the end congratulations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if

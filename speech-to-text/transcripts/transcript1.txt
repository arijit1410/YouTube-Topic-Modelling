00:00:00 hey welcome to high-resolution my name is Bobby Gould Shaw and I'm Jared around it we're going to sit down with 25 masters of the design industry and we're going to learn from them we're going to learn how the best companies in the world approach communicate and deploy design and their businesses every single day in this episode or experiences and you stories 
00:00:30 how to lead a discussion we're going to get to that stick around right after these partner messages thanks to Squarespace for their support whether you need a domain a website or an online store make your next move is Squarespace visit squarespace.com and enter the code high-resolution one word for 10% off your first purchase hey thanks for joining us what's one thing about this it's clear to you that you feel 
00:01:00 is not so good other people getting better but I would say some still don't know that design is more than what you see Steve Jobs said that it's not just what it looks like the how it works I'm paraphrasing of course I believe in that but there's a little bit more to that when we think about design Ralph and thinking about solving problems design its simplest is just being intentional about something trying to sell 
00:01:30 problem thinking about the end-user hopefully doing so in and maybe a collaborative fashion and it heard of fashion these are often times the rules of design but you can use those tools for really something kind of almost any problem so it might be in what the interface on a nap looks like and what color is it has and where the button go and how that works but it can also be the strategy or the shape of the org and how people work together and who were 
00:02:00 these are the types of things that you can use that tool set of design that's all for and I don't know if that's wide enough it's known wide enough but we're getting there for sure what is what is that tool set so that's interesting so it sounds like you're saying that there's this thing that we can use call design for things outside of user interfaces we can solve business problems and we can design teams using this process what what are some of the things that you've used in this process 
00:02:30 let's be clear while there are people that have job titles that and go designer like myself to teach design is a method for solving problems as I mention it's about bringing intentionality to it and good design I feel includes a humanistic approach try to consider who the end user is and don't work you might be thinking about what who are the people in that organization that are going to 
00:03:00 affected by what the shape of that organization looks like and so either you bring the tools of research and you get out and you learn from those individuals what they want what they don't want try to understand and what might come of these decisions that you might make and then the other part of the tool set is iteration designers great designers utilize iteration and so that might mean that they make a low Fidelity version of their their idea their solution first and test it out so that they again can learn from the end-user 
00:03:30 to know whether or not it's working basically leaving your assumptions on the table so to speak and trying to find what that right solution might be another tool in that tool set would be a collaboration a great designer believe works with a collaborative team a multidisciplinary team because and we don't know every answer and I'm trying to say that because I can solve just about any problem well we're not an expert and just about any problem people using designer not an expert in everything so you have to bring people together other experts 
00:04:00 can learn from in order to develop those Solutions one of the things that in my in my designer past I found to be really interesting is iteration once you get the hang of it once you understand that that's a key component of the design process it become so obvious that you need to do it cuz I think mother superpowers designer tab is that we can just create stuff from The Ether and do it a thousand times really quickly 
00:04:30 Engineers don't have that Leisure but the kind of Flip Side to that coin is when you enter 8 on something and you do it at low Fidelity the business people might like the non-designers seem to generally not be able to get past the fact that it looks like crap but and needs to look like crap in order in order for it to move forward like how would you explain the art of iteration of the importance of iteration to someone in the business 
00:05:00 okay I know it's here you it can be difficult to show somebody something that isn't all the way I thought through and you know they start poking it and will that that copy is wrong or you know that it's too big for the area that's going to be and they might have great points but you're you're trying to direct their conversation props to something else I've been keeping it low Fidelity and helping them see the stages of what you're working towards I think one way to solve for that is that you show them what like what you can do 
00:05:30 terms of the High Fidelity version like moved it to this polished screen that has all the right bells and whistles but in order to get there first. Make sure we have no idea right or interaction model right or like let's make sure that you know before we go and move desks around you know when we're going to put new signage up and everything but before we do that like let's try to scenario plan here what is it going to look like when we have people over here and poop over there I've been think through and some of those scenarios like what was going to come in at what meeting right like you give yourself examples of that 
00:06:00 but I think that they need to be able to know that you will get it to the end speaking about organizational design if you've been here for a few years and Airbnb since then the design side is like reshuffle of it right now structure however you guys work together and that's a that's like it's going to happen that sense of adaptability but how is everybody at your post office yeah I mean I would definitely going to company with him hyper growth and yeah I start 
00:06:30 here almost 3 years ago and it was about 10 people in the experience of 19 and now it's close to 80 how to change but so much has it maintained through that a lot of the good things in and some of the challenges of course to I guess how we approached it is that one starting from what do we want to stay the same and knowing that we're going to growing in our mission is help anyone belonging 
00:07:00 where and you know we can't do that unless we scale our mission requires that kind of global scale but if we're going to do that if we can expand our team here and abroad and make sure that we're spending our product we need to figure out when what are the things that are principles or values that you just can't change and I think we're pretty lucky that our Founders got that from the get-go and they prioritize culture on a cultures been a really big thing for Airbnb and I think that's one of the reasons why we've been six 
00:07:30 because we worked really hard to make sure that everybody that works here is passionate about the mission is excited to embrace the adventure of building a business ends in uncertainty and challenge has come to a head of us and that people are really strong and their skills and that I think has helped to make sure that they are no matter what we do and no matter where you are in the world you know you're working long Summit side somebody that you don't mind that you're banging your head against the wall through late at night 
00:08:00 I got a heart problem I can trust the people that we work with him that's been a big deal so when I first joined super small Peanut the time I will have the right size but I have 10 people time to utilize in research and so I did one-on-one interviews with people on the team I did what I want interviews with 
00:08:30 Partners II product an engine try to understand it and what was working and what wasn't working with them in the designers of course me to look at the work and there where the process was and how things were going there basically just do you know any other design project and then started too kind of shape what the opportunity and again it's not like we're just going to let you know to redesign the design team without in cluding the designers and the product manager. 
00:09:00 and so we did a lot of workshops and we talked about your the types of things that we could do to improve it one of the problems we had at the time is that wasn't a real sense of togetherness in the design team and that's because there were 10 designers and probably around 11 product teams being that the product teams were being focus on different areas of the product right and these designers were sensitive working on Islands by themselves and with engineering and project managers but not other designers and they were sitting in all sorts of different places 
00:09:30 identify that is an opportunity area the other place that we saw some challenge were the designers were feeling like they were only utilize basically at the end of the design process and they fell under utilized where nobody was happy it sounds like 
00:10:00 wasn't it in designers or intentionally left out of the decision-making process is that there's a miseducation or lack of Education around how designers actually should work into a process there's only so much I can assume it's like how it got there ain't no but I think it's everybody's at fault right how it got there right where the designers actually holding up their end of the bargain you know where the designer showing that they should be at the table at the earlier stages 
00:10:30 I mean there's any number of reasons why it might have been that way maybe the designers and walked away from that or maybe they once were at the table and it didn't work out I don't know as much as to what happened before I got here I will certainly try to understand why things were the way they were but really and it wanted to shift or thinking into how could it be better and a lot of that was about Shifting the mindset of the folks that are currently in building and also part of that was hiring so if you looked at the team and thought okay we will have these skills 
00:11:00 visual people are really good at interaction design but we're missing some facilitators we're missing the people that you know can come into the room and grab the Whiteboard marker and activate a whole room and that's in one of the places where in a designs upfront value really starts to come out right is that like before there's even an idea they're already providing value in terms of like how the thing is working now the conversation is working until we started hiring for people like that some people that we know we're going to round up a skill sets of the team 
00:11:30 the one we built into the team these different individuals people at different and kind of suit levels of seniority people with a different mix of skills it was harder to become revealing to do engineering managers as well as the designers how design can be better leverage it was inspiring for them to see how design could be a part of earlier stages in the process of planning and strategy conversations and just general facilitation so things are at the shift and we could do to build up a team another 
00:12:00 as I mentioned that we had folks on Islands right so building up a team so that we always had at least designers in pairs working on things together we and our design team here call basically all of the folks are focused on the design of the product that you are in and the you ask experience designers and that's because there's more than into the pixel 3D experience but everybody does a little bit of both UI and ux but of course there's like different levels right now 
00:12:30 so everyone is an 11:11 out of town on all fronts and so on our teams when you know you have a pair you think about like what is person's really visually strong and this person to love it more strong interaction the present together so that they can help each other and learn from each other until we have a few more designers now on the team but yeah we do we were very hard 
00:13:00 the managers and I and we're in a people are going to go and how we balance out skill sets you know I might just be because I like to drink so much but I kind of think about it it's like building a good cocktail I feel like it's all like all the ingredients to think about if they're soft skills I know some folks are a little bit in a better at the end of the conversation 
00:13:30 part of the presentation apart presentation part there's some folks that are bit more introverted some little bit more extroverted anything goes as long as you're thinking about the composition and how it comes together there's a great study and I'm not going to remember the person's name but it's a 10 talk but I'll dig up later and show you what this woman did a study about chickens and laying eggs and she basically put all of feel like the best chickens together and thought like let's see if they make the most eggs next to this other group that were 
00:14:00 dinosaur mountain Just Do It remix of chickens and lo and behold the like super group of chickens did not do better they basically fought the whole time in the other group The heterogeneous group would like nice mix of all like skill sets analogy for a team in terms of making sure you have that right mix you don't want just like the ATM and 
00:14:30 I think I don't know so it's looking good plus one plug inclusivity and things yeah the Airbnb experience of course is bigger than digital you guys have the physical world experience as well do you have the do you guys think of experience as a system or do you think of it in the worlds of physical experience and digital experience 
00:15:00 we do think of it as a system that includes digital and physical The Experience design team does include folks that are focused on UI and ux it also includes skin folks that are on focus on illustration and animation people that are more service design minded folks are a mixture of these types of things together the I guess the thing that isn't necessarily a perfectly captured in the job title is 
00:15:30 when we are looking for these individuals we're not just looking for somebody who's going to have a portfolio of nothing but pixels or could only speak about the pixels we're looking for the people that are going to be able to talk about how those pixels have ramifications in the real world and can consider those ramifications which you know is really something that kind of transcends time and place I mean it can be very challenging things but that's the Crux of what Airbnb is the pixels which of course you are our tools to in 
00:16:00 this experience they're only a very small part of an experience someone has an air B&B most of it probably 99% of it is then in the offline World interacting with strangers people that probably speak a different language on another side of the planet and so it's imperative that were thinking about those things when we're looking at a pixel in so something as simple as you know the words that we choose to the size of the buttons are they inability to get to the button is going to be impacted by the fact that you know somebody might be on their phone 
00:16:30 turn into a locked apartment and it's late at night until we have a Giants and it was on the wall for all to see but we actually use it things like this in our design process every day I've been thinking about in terms of pictures and in terms of those stories like a comic strip what is the experience that someone's going through what is the context of their use and that really does help 
00:17:00 remind us that it's more than just what we see on you know where screens there and that's one of the many things that we need to do of course research and getting out there ourselves using the park or cells or other ways to reminder inspector a design Centric company Design Center company is one that probably doesn't leave well enough alone 
00:17:30 I meant know that I thinking of people the end-users first wants and needs to change and evolve and to stay ahead of it by looking for opportunity and iterating and trying new things and exploring with a want to make it better I think that's it do you think Airbnb is that yes I would definitely 
00:18:00 we're lucky that we have design at the the heart of this company I wonderful thing and see how I'd say an advantage to having design as part of the company from the gecko and that's kind of permitted within our culture and I mention that culture is so important it's not like we're hiring for designers no matter what and I'm across the entire board no matter what this winter in 
00:18:30 but certainly thinking about the end user is a part of it at one of our core values is being a host and that is a very design like thing I know right it was I thinking about you who's going to use this is how they're going to interact with it and that should be a part of every day thinking and I think we also have a rather ambitious culture where in a we do want to make a big impact in this world in our mission is to have anyone belong anywhere and that is a big meaty mission right 
00:19:00 anyone anywhere right and that's basically Shifting the the mindset of a whole lot of this planet but we're here because we do believe that we can go after that but we're going to have to take on a lot of heavy and hard work to get there by then I think that's a part of the design septic part of it stop being afraid to try something different thanks again to Squarespace for supporting to show Squarespace is the all-in-one platform to get a domain create a website for building online store

00:20:30 Vitalis the teams to when you don't get feedback from others early and often you can get lost in the woods and that's just bad for everyone and 3 without a prototype it can be hard to show others your full vision for design in Vision salts all of that you can rapidly Prototype at the front end of the design process and collaborate across every stage of the project it simplifies virtually every aspect of the design workflow and makes collaboration a core part of the process for everyone from Project managers to designers develop 
00:21:00 and Riders teams that build digital products are in a serious Advantage when they use in Vision Suite A prototyping and collaboration tools it's the best way to get everyone on board visit Envision app.com and use our access code inv high-resolution for 3 months free so few years ago everybody put out a Rebrand and it's I mean it's beautiful like we just walked by the load ourselves coming into this room by anytime you're launching something that big especially when it's in brand when you could 
00:21:30 preview it to the majority of the world there could be a lot of fear of weather is going to be well-received and it's going to fail right now it did not go up there but walk us through that that experience of actually designed a thing at the Paragon team for such a big lunch and for whatever exception you guys may have received the rebranding a company that at that time was a pretty large 
00:22:00 tell me about 1500 2000 people worldwide people do about our product all around the world and we were about to change the face of it so yeah it was and it's scary it's exciting but it wasn't anything done overnight it wasn't anything done in a vacuum and I think that helped give us the confidence that it was the right thing to do or going in the right direction we went through a very long design process in terms of creating the logo and typography which did happen before I was here it was 
00:22:30 close to 6 months of iteration and our house Community for one as well as some gas were a part of that process and we did get feedback from folks along the way and when we applied it to the product until you're bringing the color system the typographer system in really just the kind of the essence of the new brands to the product that as well it was probably even more challenging because we're about to move things around on people that have been using our product for many years and we did that again with included parts of our community obviously we couldn't share it with 
00:23:00 called yet but we wanted to understand that it wasn't just what we thought was right but that the others could identify with it our product is all about a community and so of course it couldn't be done completely and isolation what do you think the learning here is that in a when you're launching something and it helps if she can do your best to remove the rest of the surprise and then try to iterate in as we talked about earlier with a kind of maybe a lower Fidelity version or a partial version 
00:23:30 and try to test aspects of your hypothesis so that when you are launching something that you put all this Blood Sweat and Tears in the reactions shouldn't be surprising I'm at scale you know you never know what happens of course you have to be ready for that and you know you know you have to know you tried your best and that you can always change you can always iterate especially in the digital world we're very lucky that we can in a fine tune as time goes in and observe feedback but yeah I think it could be hard for a designer to 
00:24:00 it kind of put their heart and soul out there through their work and feel at risk of what would have people hate it but you know if you don't try anything you'll never get to a better solution and that risk that you take can be minimized I have through going through a process of including others and trying it yourself and prototyping and experimenting with whatever you can so that by the time you get there you'll know with confidence that it's the right direction informed 
00:24:30 miss you but not it's it's not you can stick your finger in the air and I hope that you do the right thing you guys put in all the work up front to make sure that your core Community loved it and that when you guys actually went to Market it was in the back of it you're waiting for the masses it was by believing in the decision process and the design process and of course now 2 years later what an amazing brand it is right what an amazing Mark and it's everywhere and it's friendly and it's beautiful I think it's looked at as one of the great rebrands so congratulations 
00:25:00 so earlier you mentioned that everybody uses storyboards to document like to use our journey that you're going to be designing for right outside of design process turtling ask one of those examples of using a maybe a lower Fidelity way of getting to what the end solution should be so you can kind of gained by an and demonstrated Direction and excited and also prototype it to understand whether or not it's the right thing so storytelling can be really at any 
00:25:30 age of the Unicorn product development process with problem solving process it's a powerful one because it's something that every individual can identify with and so if we can tell the story of what a person is going to go through and we help people kind of start to understand a little bit about that person and see what challenges they might have and how this might be better for them they can start to see themselves within that and they start to imagine you people they know and experiences they've had and it really helps to 
00:26:00 the heart strings and get that understanding of what it could be in somewhere that might come in let's say that we have no a new idea for a new product and we could talk about the list of features of this new product like you're going to be like one-click to such-and-such whatever whatever 
00:26:30 imagining something different or what that's going to be and everyone's probably thinking of what they already know of and just thinking of us and it was like very and on top of that but let's say instead you or anyone on the team who's got another idea for a new feature that's going to be something that no one's ever seen before and you want them to understand that you told him the story maybe you help them understand what the current predicament is alright well we have you know a family of 5 they want to go away to Vermont in the weekend 
00:27:00 the mom spends 3 hours and Airbnb trying to find the right place she needs in a wheelchair for a wheelchair or young kids and they have a pet and they're going through all of these trials and tribulations to find the right place now let's imagine that with this new feature that and we already know what her needs are because we've seen that from her previous booking so she comes in and right front and center are the places that we know would be the right fit for her and you can show this to pictures 
00:27:30 and highlight the things that this place will have based on her needs and you can talk about how this experience is going to be better for her and really like to help them understand like her name is Anne and she lives in Newark New Jersey and cultivate this kind of understanding of contacts that now and the people in the room are all the sudden like getting these really kind of like visceral images in their mind about an from Newark and the trials and tribulations of her booking experience 
00:28:00 can a little bit about that product idea that you had instead of a list of features you told it in the story of what that thing might look like in the headlights you can break it down two features later you can scope out the engineering work later at first and just like any other human would try to understand it in terms of you know what the person is going through my mess with people can really identify with and so it helps sell the story and it helps frame saw the work frame at work and helps you actually even execute on it because you can be reminded of those 
00:28:30 stages and needs to go through so that you don't leave anything out when you're actually building it talk about storytelling for a second I think one of the most interesting exciting things that airbnb's launch recently strips super cool can you think back to maybe like one of the first conversations you had with Brian or really any anyone on your team or in one of the business at where you told a story then ballet 
00:29:00 headed that trips might be a thing that's interesting to explore the can you can you think back to a time where that raps from a long time as I mentioned that storyboard us a really powerful tool and thinking about trips because when we put it together and this was before I got here that destroyed first came together it has I think like 15 frames or something like this in so it's got guest frames like a comic strip and Scott host frames 
00:29:30 and when you do that and you look at it and think about where is the Airbnb product a part of this journey and where is it helping and where is it not you realize that it's probably only in about five of the frames there is a quite a bit of it the on offline travel experience where are you you're not using the Airbnb product that much it's so it's the host it's the place that you're traveling it's what you put yourself with one of your friends and etcetera that are actually in providing 
00:30:00 servicely experience not Airbnb and it was very revealing to us at that moment is that like me know there's more here there's more we could be doing to help people feel a sense of belonging with her traveling and that I was one we're just story like ignited this want for us to do more and then trying to go to down the pipe that you're talking about is like well how did it help us actually find the right thing to do in and get everybody excited, directions actually there were a series of stories done one where we are 
00:30:30 what might be you know a tourist experience today and I like for the opposite of what we were going for and so we filmed people that we're having this experience and finding ways that it wasn't that great until finding those moments where you know an individual was getting lost in the area called the tourist spot in the big bus over the only the fridge and and seeing the things that most tourists to and then 
00:31:00 we get another video where in a we gave the best experience of the best trip that we could and try to see what that opposite look like or what that difference look like and found that it was absolutely there was a ver there another there's a much better trip to be had where we were considering the individual and considering and what a local night do I was just what a tourist might do that I can have when your mom comes to visit and where do you take her those are the questions we should be asking not like 
00:31:30 where in of the Taurus are going and I think about those Little Gems that you know in the San Francisco that you know that's what and if we want people to see if we want to give them a sense of belonging in this place before you start finding repeatable pattern cuz I can't imagine is just the first one right cuz that's kind of one datapoint stories you tell is dependent on how many scenarios are trying to bring the light it's actually remarkable that I don't think you need to get in a hundred different people telling their 
00:32:00 in order to get you know that the quantity behind it it's actually you know you need you know just usually just a few stories to kind of in plant the seed in people's mind and let them you know remember like Bobby and Jimmy and Anna and Sarah in all these individuals just give them one or two and no latch onto the stories you can back up that sentiment for data and other ways Ryan so let's start with a story and then you know we can run a survey or you do online analytics understand like 
00:32:30 is there a lot of people that might feel that way but the thing that really takes root in people's minds the images of a take root in their mind I don't want too many cuz you too many stories and they just going to say all circuits blend together and I forget how can I design who's working at a company who has never done this process before trying to apply at this I could only imagine that there's someone watching this right now he's like well this is throwing up my stomach and throwing out all the business goals and trying to reframe it as a story to go presenta like stakeholder someone 
00:33:00 but that's probably not enough contacts the price what are the things that they should be looking for it actually presented that meeting at the great question I think it's as a people problem understanding that there are people that have this and where in your idea will take root in that world and that context the business case the quantifiable or the data that you have behind it is 
00:33:30 it's supportive it shouldn't be the lead right when you're in a setting up your pitch deck and you really want to come ignite want to and participate in this until you throw money and invest in your startup and help people understand that this is something that real people are going to deal with and then let them understand it and in a basic terms like a classic man we reached out to our community and we asked them to help us or some questions 
00:34:00 5 questions that are burning for the communities are we going to get into these next alright the first one is how do you explain the role of design two people in your business people in my bed just like the minors in Airbnb how do you explain the role of design the people at Airbnb this week we have a big company event. 
00:34:30 I talkin to solving problems just like we started here you know it's not just what something looks like but it's how it works and I have I often times and tell a story about giving them an example of where design isn't or where something was poorly designed I have because that's usually the most revealing place where like oh yes that like that could be better but I like people to understand that your design is by noon 
00:35:00 and something that you'd only this one team can own and that's one of the reasons why in the storyboard is on the wall for all to see and that's one of the reasons why it would try to be a very collaborative team is that I can we can all be problem solvers yeah we are off in the ones that are in the most skilled at leveraging tools that help us quickly visualize we're also the ones that are in her constantly exercising at muscle of problem solving and generation and experimentation but it certainly doesn't mean that something that we're going to go and do an island 
00:35:30 but I hoped you and inform people that design is very much a problem solving process and and very much one that we want them to participate in the house and design Oregon Airbnb currently are currently structured design work is for parts it's experience design design operations research and content strategy and these four parts work really closely together to meetings together we sit together we work on everything basically start to finish but that's why 
00:36:00 in the larger product or which is also a multi-disciplinary and collaborative and so we also sit alongside product managers engineer's and data scientist and the way that our Design Team Works in terms of these four parts is that we are basically integrated and distributed among the product teams we have I have area seems like Marketplace or growth and within those teams will have product managers Engineers designers data scientist researchers 
00:36:30 I just excetera all working together on that problem and so that they can be hyper focused on that problem in the goals that they have and become experts in that area but then when you think about it kind of like laterally we is a design team and interact and Cheryl learnings across because if we just look only at growth we might lose some moments in between between users journey and so that connection between designers on different teams is really important so that's why we focus 
00:37:00 I'm bringing the design team together as one entity so their business is out there with one or two designers hardly a designed to when you're the only designer in a company how do you convince the company of the value of design I got you if you're the only one so I guess I know some that we were essentially in 
00:37:30 elevator at first then we were Venture Capital firm essentially what was different about us and that we invested in startups of design and receive equity in return and his work early save startups like really small teens at x 5 people in an engineer or two marketing person in the CEO and they were there was a great sign that they understood designed to some extent but yeah you know of course A lot of times when they're bringing one designer that they're looking for that it'll make it look pretty type of thing and I think one thing that a designer 
00:38:00 you know it needs to do in order to scale themselves and to really have impact is to you no help that team see more than that see more than just the in pixels but also the process to get there and include them in and help them understand the value of user research getting out there and talking to people it's remarkable how many companies don't do that I'll get out there and and start storyboarding the journey and what are people going through and think about you know what is it working when is it not 
00:38:30 before I almost wanted to leave my company and create a story map because it was such a need for startups to actually think about their Journey because a lot of them are at and if you think about your journey and you put a baby in a storyboard or a diagram and then you map it I can we call it a happiness curve and you draw a line like when is it going well and when is it bad super revealing right she's might be imma get that whole team around that idea they can start to understand a little bit more 
00:39:00 and hopefully we'll see your value but more importantly hopefully it will start to you know in bed those Sentiments of design and that told her that we talked about originally in order to make the company better so at large how should designers actually Define measure and then presented design results when their project I don't know if we've ever talked about it as just design results probably because we're so kind of hyper focus on being really collaborative team 
00:39:30 that's where the best results come from is they have through this team is going to balancing and leveraging these different disciplines put design actually works really close with the data scientist team and of course we are at the start of a design project or a a product development project we're going to look at and where are we now and what it what are the challenges today and and then we start to impeach the other Solutions we're including data science in that price 
00:40:00 a lot of times and they're bringing great ideas to the table in terms being solution based on me and some of the things that they're seeing and different trends that have been happening over time but also they're helping us kind of shape how we might ship it right so engineering and data science or really major part of how we're going to go and watch something that it's very rare that we launched something that's just like a holy new overhaul of a product 
00:40:30 the reason why is because it's very difficult to learn from and so often times what we're doing is taking that in a kind of end result that dream scenario the end Vision that we've created and breaking it into smaller pieces that we can ship learn from it right on and then build on and build on it so you know by the end of the year for months we've completely overhauled the work but it's been a step came to that and there's any help us do that and so when we're looking at each individual staff 
00:41:00 seeing how it's working those are the moments where we're going to assessing whether or not it was a success and yeah I don't know if we ever think about it in terms of like with the design of success with the products and I want to add more than just the design of course I think we could finish with this question as the purpose of design starts to evolve and continues to evolve as it has been for the last decade what are some roles and methodologies that will continue to emerge over the next five years 
00:41:30 what's so exciting I I don't know but I certainly I'm seeing a greater and greater need for designers to think outside the pixels which is ironic because everything is becoming more and more digital and of course and we're getting into virtual reality and and things are becoming three-dimensional but all the more reason that we have to think in a Beyond those screens and those goggles in the various devices machines are coming and they're absolutely and our machines are coming they're here 
00:42:00 they are replacing a lot of the things that humans do everyday but that only unlocks more opportunity for humans to spend their time and their brain space and one other things one example is in design pools are getting ever more robust and capable and then that they're starting to bring design and Engineering closer together and so that we can you know create in Prototype it and build make all at the same time just really exciting but because of that 
00:42:30 then we have moments in our day that we can think about other things right hopefully it helps make those things faster and so we can think about in the challenges of in a two individuals that don't speak the same language on the other side of the planet coming together putting aside their diocese and to know their inability to understand each other's first starting point to actually break down those barriers those are the things that we can be spending your time thinking about in a government where does a 
00:43:00 policy thinking about more inwardly how they might design their company is it supposed to and it just following suit with what was there before so I'm excited I do there always have to follow I still don't know where the time it's okay I think we make it up on a day-to-day basis and I think we definitely. 
00:43:30 looks like and I'll need to really think about how things work and think about how we can apply that to things that you aren't already being designed but things that you are in desperate need of new ways of thinking and not leaving well enough alone wow well thank you so much Katie and skinny hey you made it to the end congratulations thanks for watching the episode I really really hope you liked it if you did like it please leave us a review on the iTunes Store and by the way if you have any questions that came up because of the content with no because 
00:44:00 but I guess go on YouTube go on Twitter you can tweet us you can leave us a comment will get back to you will help you as much as possible at hi-rez podcast that's the the screen name of the handle for Twitter for Instagram for Facebook find us talk to us we want to converse with you we're not going to leave here by the way without also thanking our friends at SeaWorld video they've been an amazing partner on this entire project video is a creative Studio based out of Portland Oregon they've helped creative community 
00:44:30 stories for over 10 years they've done advertisement behind the scenes footage and documentaries for companies like Google slack XOXO Festival Adobe until they're incredible they traveled with us for the entire country documenting me stories with our guess that's incredible thank you so much so listen if your startup looking to elevate your product your big company looking to humanize your brand you're somewhere in the creative Community he just wants to tell a story 
00:45:00 you got to check out the team at sterile video it's sterile video.com Searle video.com check out our friends that's all thank you so much guys you guys been incredible on this project
